/**
 * Define all blocks provided by the module.
 *
 * Any module can export a block (or blocks) to be displayed by defining
 * the _block hook. This hook is called by theme.inc to display a block,
 * and also by block.module to procure the list of available blocks.
 *
 * @return
 *   An associative array whose keys define the $delta
 *   for each block and whose values contain the block descriptions. Each
 *   block description is itself an associative array, with the following
 *   key-value pairs:
 *   - 'info': (required) The human-readable name of the block.
 *   - 'cache': A bitmask of flags describing how the block should behave with
 *     respect to block caching. The following shortcut bitmasks are provided
 *     as constants in common.inc:
 *     - DRUPAL_CACHE_PER_ROLE (default): The block can change depending on the
 *       roles the user viewing the page belongs to.
 *     - DRUPAL_CACHE_PER_USER: The block can change depending on the user
 *       viewing the page. This setting can be resource-consuming for sites
 *       with large number of users, and should only be used when
 *       DRUPAL_CACHE_PER_ROLE is not sufficient.
 *     - DRUPAL_CACHE_PER_PAGE: The block can change depending on the page
 *       being viewed.
 *     - DRUPAL_CACHE_GLOBAL: The block is the same for every user on every
 *       page where it is visible.
 *     - DRUPAL_NO_CACHE: The block should not get cached.
 *   - 'weight', 'status', 'region', 'visibility', 'pages':
 *     You can give your blocks an explicit weight, enable them, limit them to
 *     given pages, etc. These settings will be registered when the block is first
 *     loaded at admin/block, and from there can be changed manually via block
 *     administration.
 *     Note that if you set a region that isn't available in a given theme, the
 *     block will be registered instead to that theme's default region (the first
 *     item in the _regions array).
 *
 * After completing your blocks, do not forget to enable them in the
 * block admin menu.
 *
 * For a detailed usage example, see block_example.module.
