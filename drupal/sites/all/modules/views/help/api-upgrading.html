In order to take advantage of the changes in Drupal 7, Views has gone through several API changes.
Here's what you should know.

<h3>Handler registry</h3>

Views now uses Drupal's dynamic-loading code registry.
You can safely remove your implementations of hook_views_handlers(), since they are no longer used.

Please remember to specify the handlers in your module's .info file. For example:
<pre>
name = Example module
description = "Gives an example of a module."
core = 7.x
files[] = example.module
files[] = example.install

; Views handlers
files[] = includes/views/handlers/example_handler_argument_string.inc
</pre>

<h3>Removed handlers</h3>

Note that views_handler_filter_float has been removed.
This functionality is now handled by views_handler_filter_numeric.
There's no need for having a special handler any more, thanks to the new DB layer in Drupal 7.
