Insert is a utility that makes inserting images and links to files into text
areas or WYSIWYGs much easier. It adds a simple JavaScript-based button to
FileField and ImageField widgets. When used with ImageField and ImageCache,
images may be inserted into text areas with a specific Image style.

Insert was written by Nate Haug.

Dependencies
------------

Insert module does not have any dependencies, but it won't do anything unless
you have at least one of the following installed:

* FileField
* ImageField

Recommended
-----------

* ImageCache
* WYSIWYG module

Install
-------

1) Copy the insert folder to the modules folder in your installation. Usually
   this is sites/all/modules.

2) In your Drupal site, enable the module under Administer -> Site building ->
   Modules (/admin/build/modules).

3) Add or configure a FileField or ImageField under Administer -> Content
   management -> Content types -> [type] -> Manage Fields
   (admin/content/node-type/[type]/fields). Once configuring a field, there is a
   new section in the Field options for "Insert". You can then configure the
   field to include an Insert button and what templates you would like to have.

4) Create a piece of content with the configured field. After uploading a file,
   an "Insert" button will appear. Click this button to send the file or image
   into the Body field.

Insert should would on multiple fields (the last field that was active will
received the file), and with most popular WYSIWYG editors. Note that FCKeditor
only supports the Body field due to an API limitation.
