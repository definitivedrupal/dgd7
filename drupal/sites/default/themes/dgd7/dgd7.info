; STYLESHEETS (pg. 341-347)
;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Stylesheets handling is totally broken in .info files, so I can't recommend
; using it for most use cases:
;
; Files added here:
; - Load on every page, whether they were supposed to in the first place or not.
; - Are grouped in a separate <style> tag with aggregation turned off and
;   preprocessed and aggregated together when turned on in a <link> tag, which
;   means you get once step closer to the 31 stylesheet limit in IE.
; - Do not support the full range of drupal_add_css() functionality. So, you
;   cannot do any of the following really common tasks:
;   - Fully remove a stylesheet by overriding it. The second an AJAX render
;     request is made, not only will the files you removed load, but they will
;     added at the bottom of the stack and which can royally break your design.
;   - Add conditional stylesheet for IE.
;   - Add an external stylesheet, such as a Google or Typekit font.
;
; So, stylesheets for this theme have been are being managed in template.php:
; - Added via dgd7_preprocess_html() in template.php.
; - Removed via dgd7_css_alter() in template.php.
