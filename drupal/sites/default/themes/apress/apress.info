; STYLESHEETS
;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Stylesheets handling is totally broken in .info files, so I can't recommend
; using it for themes that load any stylesheets conditionally, i.e. ad admin.css
; file that only loads in /admin section.  I also do not recommend it when
;
; Files added here:
; - Load on every page, whether they were supposed to in the first place or not.
; - Are grouped in a separate <style> tag with aggregation turn off and
;   preprocessed and aggregated together when turned on in a <link> tag, which
;   means you get once step closer to the 31 stylesheet limit in IE.
; - Do not support the full range of drupal_add_css() functionality. So, you
;   cannot do any of the following really common tasks:
;   - Fully remove a stylesheet by overriding it.  The second an AJAX render
;     request is made, not only will the files you removed load, but they will
;     added at the bottom of the stack and will royally break your design.
;   - Add conditional stylesheet for IE.
;   - Add an external stylesheet, such as a Google or Typekit font.
;   - Lose the ability to maintain control of the order in which the files are
;     loaded.
;
; So, stylesheets for this theme have been:
; - Added via apress_preprocess_html() in template.php.
; - Removes via apress_css_alter() in template.php.
